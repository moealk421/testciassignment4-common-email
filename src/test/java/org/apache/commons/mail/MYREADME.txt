Hello, this assignment was completed by first:

Downloading Java 11.09 and Eclipse IDE listed in canvas assignment 03.

After downloading the required software, I opened eclipse created a new maven project and the pom.xml appeared and I clicked finish. The JRE System Library was then manually changed by right clicking commons-email properties, Java build path, add library and manually pick java 11. Jdk-11 should appear on JRE system library.

Junit 4.11 was used and can be seen in pom.xml. 

As for the tests that were written, there are a total of four classes including one concrete class.
You can find all of the classes in src/test/java and there will be a package named org.apache.commons.mail.

To run all test cases at once, right click commons-email -> coverage as -> 3 Junit Test.

If there is any confusion, I followed the same steps that were shown in canvas modules.

Thank You
